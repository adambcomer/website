These photographs are from an early winter hike that I did in Lakewood,
Colorado. What I liked the most about this time of year is the dark colors from
the deep blues to the pine greens.

During this this trip, I experimented with up close shots of the subjects that
give the pine needles and dried flowers a dreamy look.
